-Draw it or Lose it is an application that allows user to compete against one another by guessing what an image is before it fully renders on the screen. The client was the Gaming Room, who needed us to develop this application as cost efficient as possible, with a good user interface. 

-I thought I did a good job of laying out the pros and cons of each operating system so that our client could see why I picked the Mac OS over the others.

-I found that explaining each class in the design document allowed me to easily develop and understand what each class was doing for the application.

-If I could revise one part, I would definitely add more to the pros of the Windows OS. I definitely could of added a couple more things such as microsoft edge and windows security system.

-The user will ultimately decide if our application is successful or not, which is why it is vital to make sure they are happy. I made sure to implement 
things such aa having a fast loading time to ensure the user had a good experience.

-I approched designing software as the overall blueprint to building something. I had to make it as clear and concise as possible so that the actual coding part would go smoothly.
